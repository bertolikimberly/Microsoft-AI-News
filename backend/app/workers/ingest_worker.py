"""
Ingest worker — fetches articles from all RSS sources and indexes them
into pgvector without generating digests.

Triggered by POST /api/v1/internal/run-ingest (see routers/internal.py).
Designed to run without a user context: pulls from every source across
all scrape tiers (breaking / standard / daily).

Will later be automated via a GitHub Actions cron schedule that calls
the endpoint with WORKER_SHARED_SECRET.

Flow:
  1. Restore RSS watermark state from Postgres to disk.
  2. Fetch all sources across all tiers concurrently.
  3. Deduplicate by URL hash.
  4. LLM curation — editorial pass selects the best articles.
  5. Embed and upsert into pgvector via ArticleVectorStore.
  6. Save updated watermarks back to Postgres.
