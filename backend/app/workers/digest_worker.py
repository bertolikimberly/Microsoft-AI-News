"""
Digest worker — generates and persists daily digests (F3).

Triggered by the /api/v1/internal/run-digest-worker webhook, which is
itself fired on a schedule by .github/workflows/digest-cron.yml (GitHub
Actions cron — free, no card needed). The webhook authenticates with
WORKER_SHARED_SECRET; this module assumes the caller is trusted.

Flow (see docs/feature_endpoints.md F3):
  1. Find users whose frequency × delivery_day × delivery_hour_local
     makes today a delivery day, and who don't already have a digest
     for today (idempotency).
  2. For each eligible user:
       a. Build a pipeline UserProfile from their backend preferences.
       b. Run the LLM pipeline end-to-end (fetch → dedupe → rank → generate).
       c. Persist the resulting NewsletterDigest as Digest + DigestItem
          + Article rows via the integrations.llm_bridge adapter.

The LLM pipeline lives in the sibling `llm_engineering/` tree; we put it
on sys.path via integrations.bootstrap so backend code can import from
`src.*` without packaging it as a wheel.
