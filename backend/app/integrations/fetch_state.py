"""
Persist the RSS fetcher's per-source watermarks across Container Apps
restarts (L4).

Container Apps with scale-to-zero recycles the container between cron
fires. The fetcher (app/pipeline/ingestion/fetcher.py) writes state to
a JSON file on disk, which evaporates with the container. Without this
bridge, every cold start re-fetches everything — wasteful and risky.

Approach: bracket each pipeline run with restore/save. The fetcher
itself still does file I/O (honours the FETCH_STATE_PATH env var); we just snapshot the file to / from
Postgres around the call.

  context-manager usage:
    with persisted_fetch_state(db, path):
        await pipeline.run_for_user(profile)

The state file path is read from FETCH_STATE_PATH (set in the Bicep env
list); falls back to /tmp/fetch_state.json which works locally too.

    Bracket a pipeline run: restore state before, save state after.

    `db` is a backend Session. The fetcher uses plain file I/O while
    inside the `with` block — we just translate the file boundary to a
    DB boundary on either side. The `path` defaults to whatever the
    fetcher will read from (FETCH_STATE_PATH or /tmp/fetch_state.json).

    Failures here are logged and swallowed — fetch state is a perf
    optimisation, never a correctness requirement. Worst case the

    pipeline catches dupes on insert.
